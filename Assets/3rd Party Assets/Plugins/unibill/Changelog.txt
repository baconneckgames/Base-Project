to make iOS consistent with other billing platforms in this regard.

updated correctly.

for existing Unibill integrations but makes the checkout flow much faster.

Localised product details are now available for Google Play.

1.1.2

iOS - Fixed Unibiller.onTransactionsRestored event not firing if the user has no purchases.

billing service and set on InventoryItem.

Additions

-Localized price, title and description are now exposed through PurchasableItem.

 NOTE - Localized details are currently only retrieved for the App Store and Mac App Store.

- Purchase receipts can be retrieved after a purchase with a call to Unibiller.GetAllPurchaseReceipts(PurchasableItem).
