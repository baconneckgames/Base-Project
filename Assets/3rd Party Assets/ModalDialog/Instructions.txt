Simple modal dialog system for C# in Unity 4.1.2 and above
Supports text-based modal dialogs with up to three buttons
Modal dialogs prevent interaction with anything behind the dialog itself
Copyright Moment Studio/Bill Borman 2013

SETUP
-	Add the modal dialog script to the scene somewhere (anywhere is fine).
-	Add an AudioSource and assign a sound to it as well if you want button click sounds on the dialog.
-	Add the following line to the end of the OnGUI method in your GUI script:
		ModalDialog.Instance.ModalDialogGui();
-	For simple OK dialogs you may only need to show a message, but for most you'll want to take some action when the user clicks.
	If you need to take an action, your class needs to implement the IModalDialogUser interface, with the following three methods:
		void ModalSelectedButton1(string id)
		void ModalSelectedButton2(string id)
		void ModalSelectedButton3(string id)

USE
-	Check out MainSceneGUI.cs, which has examples of all the types of modal dialog available.
-	Call ModalDialog.Instance.Show() from your OnGUI method when you want to show a modal dialog
	You don't need to call it every OnGUI call - just once. The dialog will hide itself when it's closed
-	ModalDialog.Instance.ShowOK() and ModalDialog.Instance.ShowYesNoCancel() are provided as shortcuts to easily show common dialog types
-	For dialogs with callbacks, check the id string in ModalSelectedButton to take appropriate action if you have multiple dialogs that could be up
-	You may optionally show a "Don't ask me again" type check box. To set this up:
		Declare a ModalBool object in your script, e.g. ModalDialog.ModalBool showDialog;
		Instantiate it before you use it (e.g. in your Awake() method), e.g. showDialog = new ModalDialog.ModalBool(true);
		Pass it in to the modal dialog call, e.g.: ModalDialog.Instance.ShowYesNoCancel("Dialog text", ref showDialog, this, "id_yesnocancel");
		The Value of whether to show it or now will be updated and the dialog will show or not as appropriate automatically
		If you want to set it to show or not manually, just set your ModalBool.Value property, e.g. showDialog.Value = true;
-	To have a sound play on click, attach your AudioSource to the same game object as the modal dialog,
	and set a sound. On the properties of the sound itself, untick "3D Sound"

STYLES
This package comes with two complete styles for the modal dialog.
In the example scene, deactivate Modal Dialog and active Modal Dialog Alternate Look to see the second look that comes with the package.
You can set your own styles for the dialogs as well by changing the GUI Styles on the script in the inspector.
If you want to make another modal dialog in a different scene, you may want to copy-paste the whole component (right-click on it->copy component, then paste onto another Modal Dialog script) or create a prefab from it, so you don't have to set all the styles again.

MODAL DIALOG COMPONENT
What each part of the script does:
Width: Width of the dialog. Height is automatically based on the amount of content
Margin: Spacing to the content from the edge, and under the main text when not using the "Don't show again" checkbox
Spacing: All other spacing between internal content
Button height: Height of the buttons on the dialog
Tint texture: Set a texture here to act as a tint for the background behind the dialog
Background style: Style of the dialog window itself
Text style: Style for the main dialog text
Button style: Style for the buttons on the dialog
Toggle button style: Style for the "Don't show this again" toggle
Yes default text: Default text for the first button on the ShowYesNoCancel() dialog
No default text: Default text for the second button on the ShowYesNoCancel() dialog
Cancel default text: Default text for the last button on the ShowYesNoCancel() dialog
OK Default text: Default text for the simple one-button ShowOK() dialog
Don't show again text: Default text for whenever the "Don't show again" option is used

NOTES
-	Only one modal dialog can show at a time; the class is a singleton
-	The modal dialogs can also be controlled with the keyboard arrows, enter, and escape keys
	Escape chooses the rightmost button (usually Cancel), or "button 1" if there are no buttons showing
-	The modal dialog could have its own OnGUI method, negating the need for calling ModalDialogGui() from another OnGUI method,
	but each separate call to OnGUI creates extra overhead
-	ModalDialogGui() must be called last in your OnGUI method so that it shows up on top. Gui.Depth does weird things with GUI.Window (as of Unity 4.1) so we're not using it
